# CosmJS Starter Template

This repository is made for quick prototyping with CosmJS.

The messages can be changed to query/execute smart contracts and sign and broadcast transactions.

Currently it is using the Juno Network. It must be changed when working with another chain.

## Running the project

```bash
yarn start
```

## Using Ledger as a signer

```bash
yarn start --ledger
```

## Using the mainnet

```bash
yarn start --mainnet
```

## Using your own wallet

To use your own wallet, replace the mnemonic with your own. Always remember to keep your mnemonic a secret.

**DO NOT COMMIT YOUR MNEMONIC**
